You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
1/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
Scalability leads to more clients.
Scalability may increase the response time for clients.
If an application is scalable the response time may remain same or may decrease as clients increase
None of the above
 

 Solution -:      2                                                                                                                                                                       1  B

Increasing the storage/ hard disk space
Increasing the network bandwidth
Increasing the processing power
All of the above
 

 Solution -:    4




Question-3)What is true for vertical scaling:
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
It can be increased easily by removing hardware from the system
There is a limit to scaling a system vertically
Vertical scaling is not possible for monolithic systems
Vertical scaling reduces the performance of the system
  

 Solution -:     2 is the correct option.




Question-4)Why does Vertical scaling in monolithic systems has the risk of a single point of failure?
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
Multiple hard disks may fail simultaneously
All the components of the application, code, hardware additions, are present on a single system
Additional hardware may reduce the performance
Many network calls may lead to failure

 
  Solution -:    2



Question-5) Which of the following is true for vertical scaling:
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
1/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
It is prone to single point of failure
It might not be able to handle exponential increase in client
It can become very expensive after a point
All of the above

 
  Solution -:    4





Question-6)Horizontally scaling an application means that there is no single point of failure and hence the application also becomes high available. State whether the following statement is true or false.

Horizontal scaling
Both Vertical scaling & Horizontal scaling
none of the above


  Solution :    3







Question-9)  Which of the following is not true for horizontal scaling:
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
Commodity hardware is used
There are no network calls required in this type of scaling.
Multiple systems are used for scaling
Monolithic systems can be horizontally scaled


  Solution :  2

You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
True
False


  Solution :    true








Question-12)  Partition in distributed systems can be caused due to:
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem may have one or more correct answers
Absence of network
High latency
Node going down
Low availability


  Solution :    1  3
 





Question-13)  Which of the following is NOT the purpose of redundancy?
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
Removing single point of failure
High availability of the system
Providing backup in crisis
None of the above


  Solution :    4








Question-14) Which of the following statements are true?
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem may have one or more correct answers
Redundancy means having duplicate components or nodes.
In passive redundancy initial nodes are active and duplicate passive nodes are on standby, to take over in case of any failure
In active redundancy there is no duplication of nodes.


  Solution :    1  2







Question-15)  Which of the following means keeping multiple copies of data and updating them whenever any changes take place?
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
Redundancy
Latency
Replication
Fault Tolerance


  Solution :    3








Question-16)  Active replication uses the master-slave model for replicating data within various servers.State whether true or false.
You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
0/2
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
True
False


  Solution :    false







Question-17)  Practice Question
 
Three of the classmates are copying the programming assignment from Rahul. After every 1-2 days Rahul makes some modifications in the assignment. Now, his classmates also keep updating the assignment whenever any modification is done. Which kind of replication is this? Can you identify the master and slave nodes from the example?
 


  Solution :    Solution Description
This is an example of Passive replication because in passive replication there is only one server that processes client requests. After processing a request, the primary server updates the state on the other (backup) servers and sends back the response to the client. Similarly, in this question, Rahul is that primary server who processes requests and his classmates then update their assignments from Rahul's assignment. Here, Rahul acts as the master, and his classmates act as slaves nodes.
