1  If a user needs to do online bank transactions which of the following should be developed:
 

 Solution :          Web applications                                                                                                                                                                   1  B
 


2   Which of the following is true:
 
Options

This problem has only one correct answer
Web site can only contain static information in the form of text
Web application allows user to read as well as write
'Web application’ and ‘Web sites’ should be used interchangeably
Web site does not have a logic layer
 

 Solution :   Web application allows user to read as well as write 




3  Which of the following layers of a web application is closest to the user?
 
 Solution :    Front end




4   Which layer contains the logic of a web application:
 

 
  Solution :   Business layer
 




5   Which of the following is true for monolithic architecture?


 
  Solution :    Front end, back end and data storage layer of a web application are present on the same system





6    Which of the following is true for monolithic architecture:
 
This problem has only one correct answer
Any error or bug in a module can break the complete system
For each update, the complete code has to be deployed again
Any change in programming language or framework will affect the entire system
All of the above


  Solution :    All of the above



7   What are the challenges of having the entire application code (Front end, back end and data storage layer) as a single codebase?


  Solution :   If all the layers are present as a single codebase, then it would be difficult to modify the code as it would be tightly coupled. A lot of time and effort would be required after every minor change, as the whole  application code would be deployed again. Thorough testing would be required  as a change in one layer may lead to changes in other layers. Plus, when the code will increase with time, it would become difficult to manage. Using different technologies would be difficult due to compatibility issues of a single codebase. 







Question-8)  In which of the following situations, monolithic architecture should be preferred:



  Solution :    When resources are limited
Developers have little to no experience
The application has limited number of users







Question-9)  Which of the following is true for monolithic system:


  Solution :    Same codebase is used for development





Question-10)  Monolithics requires less network calls.


  Solution :    True










Question-11)  Out of the two, which web application should definitely have less latency:


  Solution :  Online banking application  








Question-12)  Which of the following statements is/are true ?


  Solution :   For the microservices application, each service has its own database and follows the principle of single responsibility.
For microservices applications, if the services want to share data or communicate with each other, it's done through the APIs over the network. 
 





Question-13)  Selecting scaling of specific components is possible in case of Microservices based applications.


  Solution :    True








Question-14) Which of the following statements are true for microservices?


  Solution :    Since the components are loosely coupled, the changes can be made easily in the components.
Multiple technologies and different techstack can be used to develop microservices architecture based applications







Question-15)  What are the benefits of using microservices architecture over monolithic?


  Solution :    If an application needs frequent addition of features and updating existing features, then Microservice architecture would be a better option.








Question-16)  When should the Microservice Architecture be used?


  Solution :    






 

       !!!!!! Assignment !!!!!




Question-1)    Suppose you have to build an e-commerce application that takes orders from the customers, verifies inventory and ships the products to them. It must also support different clients such as desktop browsers, mobile browsers and mobile applications. Keeping in the above scenario answer the following questions.
Think of the different layers and components it should have?
 

 Solution -:       User interface showing products available in store, a business logic layer which has components like, catalogue, order, payment, shipping etc. and the data access layer containing all the data.                                                                                                                                                                      1  B
 


Question-2) Suppose you have to build an e-commerce application that takes orders from the customers, verifies inventory and ships the products to them. It must also support different clients such as desktop browsers, mobile browsers and mobile applications. Keeping in the above scenario answer the following questions.
If you have a small team of new developers who should be made productive at the earliest, which kind of architectural pattern would you prefer? Why?

 

 Solution -:    Monolithic. Since it's the beginning of development, the code would be simple and easy to modify.




Question-3)  Suppose you have to build an e-commerce application that takes orders from the customers, verifies inventory and ships the products to them. It must also support different clients such as desktop browsers, mobile browsers and mobile applications. Keeping in the above scenario answer the following questions.
Suppose after some time, the application becomes larger, with more clients and larger team size. Will the current approach have any drawbacks?

  

 Solution -:    Yes, large code will make it difficult to manage and  perform testing due to high coupling. A huge number of clients lead to overloaded servers and hence the need for scalability. 




Question-4) Suppose you have to build an e-commerce application that takes orders from the customers, verifies inventory and ships the products to them. It must also support different clients such as desktop browsers, mobile browsers and mobile applications. Keeping in mind the above scenario answer the following questions.
Which components should be scaled to run the application smoothly?

 
  Solution -:    Web server should be scaled to handle incoming requests of clients, systems would inc computational power to handle large number of operations, database servers should also be accessed




Question-5) Suppose you have to build an e-commerce application that takes orders from the customers, verifies inventory and ships the products to them. It must also support different clients such as desktop browsers, mobile browsers and mobile applications. Keeping in mind the above scenario answer the following questions.
Is there any drawback of scaling the existing monolithic application?


 
  Solution -:    With a monolithic architecture, we cannot scale each component independently, also scalability is possible only up to a certain limit.





Question-6) Suppose you have to build an e-commerce application that takes orders from the customers, verifies inventory and ships the products to them. It must also support different clients such as desktop browsers, mobile browsers and mobile applications. Keeping in mind the above scenario answer the following questions.
Can you think of the benefit of using microservices architecture for this scenario?



  Solution :    Microservices based architecture will help in scaling the components independently. Also, heterogeneous technologies can be used for  faster operations and large teams can work independently on the individual components of the application leading to faster development.
