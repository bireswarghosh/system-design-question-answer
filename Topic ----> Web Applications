Read the Following Statement:
Let's suppose you want to create an online bookstore. The application can be used to browse the books, get book details and order books.
Based On the above statement answer the following question:
What can be the possible issues if client-server architecture is not used?
 
 
 
Solution  -:
Here, the online bookstore application can be considered a single piece of software that needs to be downloaded from the internet. This monolithic application will contain all the required details of books and orders. So whenever a new book has to  be added or deleted, or any other details are modified, the entire application needs to be re-distributed again to the users. Since, the books catalogue will change frequently, this will lead to repeated distribution of the application.

Let's suppose you want to create an online bookstore. The application can be used to browse the books, get book details and order books.
Based On the above statement answer the following question:
How can client-server architecture help?
 
 
 
 
 Solution -:   
The client-server architecture can be used to split the application into 2 parts. The client will have an interface that will display all the information and the server will have all the data related to the book, details , orders etc. The changes can be made to the server and will reflect on the client-side.
