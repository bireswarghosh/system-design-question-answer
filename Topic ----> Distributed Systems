Monolithic systems
Distributed systems

 
  Solution -:    2





Question-6) Practice Question
 
How replication can help in avoiding data loss in the distributed systems?


  Solution :    In a distributed system environment since nodes can be geographically distributed, a node can crash due to any reason such as natural disasters, power failures or scalability issues. Since the data is replicated on multiple servers , these replicas provide the backup and can take over avoiding the single point of failure for data.)

Question-8)  Which of the following is true for centralized and decentralized applications?

You have max 2 attempts to score in this question.
Attempts left:
2/2
Options
This problem may have one or more correct answers
A Centralized application is controlled by a single central authority
A Decentralized application has no single authority and control is distributed among different authorities.
A centralized application has no single authority and control is distributed among different authorities.
A Decentralized application is controlled by a single central authority.
In Centralized systems, the authority can lie on cluster of systems.
